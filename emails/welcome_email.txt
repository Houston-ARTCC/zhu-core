Hello {{ user.first_name }},

Let me be the first to welcome you to the Virtual Houston ARTCC! We are delighted to have you here as a controller and are excited to be able to share the joys of this wonderful hobby with you.

However, first we need to get a few housekeeping tasks out of the way. Please read this email in its entirety as it contains very important information.


Discord
We use Discord as our primary text communications platform. All ARTCC announcements are made on our Discord server and this is also where you can chat with other controllers. You can download Discord at https://discord.com.

Getting Trained
The training center, located at https://zhuartcc.org/training, is the one-stop shop for all of your training needs. Here you can request training, view booked training sessions, and see past training notes. Instructions on how to schedule a session can be found in the Training Center.
