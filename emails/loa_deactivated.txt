Hello {{ user.first_name }},

Welcome back from your leave of absence!

You are now subject to quarterly currency requirements. If your leave impacts your ability to meet these
requirements by the end of the quarter, please reach out to the ATM or DATM through Discord or by sending
an email to management@houston.center to avoid being erroneously removed from the roster.
